<h2> "Nice Colors"</h2>

<p>[Khai Dreams & Atwood:]
Okay now Yeah
I'm going in no time to play
I got a dream I wanna chase
I stack the money in the bank
Okay now
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I kick my feet up off the bed
I'm in full swing I wanna sway
Said do you dream or do you take
I'm in full swing I wanna

</br>[Atwood:]
Okay now hold up, hey
I got that soda, drank
I'm feelin glowed up, ay
Girl hit my phone up, hey
She told me roll up, ay
Come thru come over, k
I'm feeling lonely, ay
Still feelin lonely, k
I'm feelin over the underhanded "mmm been nice to know you's"
Like we is grown-up and understanding that shit just has overs
But not getting over overs
Our oversight been unfocused
Our overnights been the closest
I'm over hiding emotions
I said like

</br>[Khai Dreams:]
Girl why is you walking
Girl why ain't we talking
You were the one who was looking for something
I remember now why I ain't about loving
I just wanna get on my wave oh
If you dont wanna just say so
Otherwise call it a day
I got places to be I can't stay in one place oh
You know since like 16 I been all on my own two
I had to go and change it up cuz I was getting tired of my old views
I'm just going OT till they fucking know me
Till I put my city on the map yeah
Running dummy on the hunt for something
That you just can't find up in a class yeah
Nice colors in the rearview
But they ain't nothing like what's in the distance
They used to blow me off like "real cool"
Now they all trying to get a percentage
I said it I meant it im keeping it real
I was young and pretending I grew now I build
I just go with the motion and see how I feel
I just go with the motion still keeping it chill like

</br>[Khai Dreams & Atwood:]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm going in no time to play
I got a dream I wanna chase
I stack the money in the bank
I got something I gotta say
I kick my feet up out the bed
I'm in full swing I wanna sway
Said do you dream or do you take
Said do you dream or do you
